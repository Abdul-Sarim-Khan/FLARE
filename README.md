# 🔥 FLARE – Federated Learning for Anomaly Recognition & Explainability  
**by IU - Beaconers**  

FLARE is a next-generation **AI-driven cybersecurity platform** designed to detect, explain, and respond to threats in real time — while preserving data privacy through **Federated Learning**.

## 🧩 Overview
In today’s cyber landscape, Pakistan’s critical infrastructures such as **banking, telecom, healthcare, and defense** face constant threats.  
Existing tools like Splunk are expensive, centralized, and compromise privacy.

**FLARE** bridges that gap — offering a **lightweight, cost-effective, and explainable SIEM alternative** that keeps data *local* and intelligence *shared*.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧠 **1. Hybrid Detection Engine**
- **Rule-Based Detection**: Catches known attack patterns (e.g., failed logins, port scans).  
- **ML-Based Detection**: Detects novel anomalies using LSTM and Autoencoders.

### 🔒 **2. Federated Learning**
- Local models train on organization-specific logs.
- Only model weights (not raw data) are shared — ensuring privacy and sovereignty.

### 💡 **3. Explainable AI**
- Every alert comes with a reason:
  > “Unusual login at 3 AM from a new location contributed 78% to anomaly score.”

### 🧑‍💻 **4. Human-in-the-Loop Automation**
- FLARE can **auto-suggest** actions like “Block IP” or “Disable Account,”  
  but analysts make the final decision.

### 🌐 **5. Unified Dashboard**
- Real-time threat visualization  
- Event timelines and severity graphs  
- Endpoint and data ingestion monitoring
